![Geir Gliser'n Grevling & Herr Havre Rev](./image006.png)
Herr Rev hadde et halvt dusin hus (6), men han var sjelden hjemme.


The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved out; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved in; (without asking leave).

Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.
