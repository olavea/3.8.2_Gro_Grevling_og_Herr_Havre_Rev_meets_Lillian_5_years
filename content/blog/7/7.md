![Geir Gliser'n Grevling & Herr Havre Rev](./image007.png)

His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was generally Herr Havre Rev.


Now Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with gamle bestefar Benjamin Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the De Onde otterne and Herr Havre Rev; they often talked over that painful subject.
