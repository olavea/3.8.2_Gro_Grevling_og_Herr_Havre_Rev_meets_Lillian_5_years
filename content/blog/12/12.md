When Flopsy and Benjamin came backâ€”gamle bestefar Benjamin Bouncer woke up. Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!

Bamle bestefar Benjamin Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole. But the smell of Grevlinglukta was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.


Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling.
