The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears—


"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?"

"No, no, no! He's bagged my family—Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling—in a sack—have you seen him?"

"Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling! Cousin Benjamin?"

<!-- "Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way? Please tell me quick!"

"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were caterpillars; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars." -->

"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"
"Hvilken vei gikk han?"



<!-- "He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning." Benjamin did so. -->
