I have made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling and Herr Havre Rev.

Nobody could call Herr Havre Rev "nice." The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.


One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of gamle bestefar Benjamin Bouncer.
