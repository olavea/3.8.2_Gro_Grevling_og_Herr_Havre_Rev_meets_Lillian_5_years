He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.

Benjamin climbed up on the wall. He saw another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Geir "Gliser'n" Grevling. It was getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily playing tag with a little girl and a Carrot the parrot.
