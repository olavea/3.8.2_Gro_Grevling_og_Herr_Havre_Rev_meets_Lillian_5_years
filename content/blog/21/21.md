![GliseGeir Grevling & Herr Havre Rev](./image021.png)

Huset til Herr Havre Rev så ut som en blanding av hule, fengsel og rotet grisebinge.

<!-- This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked. -->

The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.

Benjamin sighed with relief.
"De lever!"

But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. There was an
enorm tom paiform med blå blomstermønster, en stor blank slakterkniv, en stor gaffel og en kjøttøks.

<!-- immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper. -->
