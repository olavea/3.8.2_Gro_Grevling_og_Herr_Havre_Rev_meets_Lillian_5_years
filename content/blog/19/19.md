The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four half-grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others pink.

–"Hvem er dere?" sa Cottontail<br/>
–"Peter, Benjamin og Lillian!"<br/>
–"Jeg kjente dere ikke igjen som Leopard, løve og enhjørning."



<!-- Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him. -->
<!--
He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.—"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny. -->

<!-- They climbed up and up; -->



<!-- —"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole." "They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!" -->
